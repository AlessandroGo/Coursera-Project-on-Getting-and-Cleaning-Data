# Codebook

## Dataset overview
The final data set includes appropriate variable names that have been processed from features.txt to have descriptive names that are appropriate for coding conventions. So, 'fBodyGyro-mean()-X' transforms into f_body_gyro_mean_x 

## Steps to Create Relevant Feature Names
Steps to clean and extract the 66 mean() / std() feature names

Load raw feature list
Read features.txt, keeping only the second column (feature), which contains the 561 original variable names.

Standardise the names

Insert underscores between lower- and uppercase letters (tBody → t_Body).

Convert the entire string to lower-case.

Strip parentheses () and commas.

Replace dashes - with underscores _.
Result: tidy, snake-case names like t_body_acc_mean_x.

Create an indexed table
Build a data.table with two columns—idx (1-561) and the cleaned name—for easy sub-setting.

Identify target variables
Use grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", feature_names) on the original (uncleaned) names to capture the exact 66 indices corresponding to measurements derived from mean() and std() (excluding meanFreq and angle variables).

Keep only those rows
Filter the data.table with the index vector, yielding features_keep: the definitive list of 66 cleaned variable names ready for sub-setting the merged dataset.

## Steps to Create Final Dataset
The activity and subject column is combined with the train set and test set respectively, then the data sets are merged. Then the activity column is given meaningful labels so 1 is mapped as:
  1 -> walking
  2 -> walking_up
  3 -> walking_down
  4 -> sitting
  5 -> standing
  6 -> laying
  
The data set is then grouped by subject and activity and summarised by mean for all columns kept. 
Note that this reduces # of observations

## Features
Features are in the range [-1, 1] for all suffixed with an x,y, or z
Features which have mag in it are in range [0, 1], this is because the euclidean distance is non-negative and original features were normalized after passing respective filters.
